1. Hi Yu,

Thank you for letting us know ahead of time.  I have copied my colleague Amy who takes care of our scheduling.  She will do her best to have this rescheduled for April 3rd and she will send you an email to confirm this.

We understand that things do pop up unexpectedly, but please try your best to keep April 3rd available for the interview.

Thanks so much,



2. Hi!
 
Just a note that my office hours this Wednesday (2/25) will be 1:30-2:30 instead of 1-2pm.  I¡¯ll be at the webinar about White Privilege on campus that ends after 1:00.
 
Also, a reminder that the Initial Data assignment for your project is due by Thursday of this week (2/26), along with any new entries in your Math Journal. 
 
The main idea of the Math Journal is for you to give me feedback about the class up to that point, on looseleaf paper, and just hand in new entries each time.  The biggest help is to record how long each HW takes, and whether it seems about the right length, or too hard (or easy), which problems (or parts of them) are good and bad (e.g., feel like busywork or a waste of time).  You can also comment about the lectures, the test, and anything else that comes to mind, or ask questions about things that are not clear yet, etc.  Think of it as writing a note to me.

 

There is no obligation to do this.  If your average for the class is borderline, then it's one factor in my deciding to bump someone up vs. down (see the syllabus for others). 

 

There's also a chance to hand in an Extra Credit set of suggestions at the end of the semester about how to improve the class in any way, including improvements on the individual homework assignments, or anything else, that can add 1-3 points to your final average, so could bump a B+ to an A-, for example, conceivably.  That is graded on the quality of the suggestions and conciseness.  Your earlier Math Journal entries can provide material for this.

 

See you tomorrow!

Hi!
 
I¡¯m enclosing the handout to help you prepare your Initial Data assignment for the project, which is targeted to be handed in a week from tomorrow.  Please read the handout carefully, and let me know if you have any questions.  Note that one part of the assignment is to hand in your original proposal, with my comments on it, and with your handwritten  responses to my comments in the margins (don¡¯t re-do the Proposal!).  That is also the time to hand in new Journal entries.
 
Remember that for the take-home, you are allowed to use any inanimate sources, and can ask me clarification (but not content) questions.
 
Take care,
Bruce

Hi Yu,
 
Can you send me your new I-20, the one you received from your school for your STEM extension?
You will also need to make sure to stop by my office with your new EAD when you receive it as it will need to be included with your H-1B petition and I will need to see it for the I-9 re-verification process.
 
 
Thanks,
Charlotte

Hi, Yu,

Here's the reference I mentioned last night.


6. Greetings,

I hope that you have continued to enjoy the topics we have covered.

A few items to note:

The forums continue to be a great place to interact with the other participants in the course. This week we have seen a case study on using Apriori on Reuters-21578 to mine NER associations, a Mendeley group for and some additional resources about the Week 3 topics. I hope you will continue to be engaged as the end of the course approaches.

A reminder that you do not have to score a 7/10 on every week¡¯s quiz to pass the course. You only need to earn an overall average score of 70%. Note that you are allowed 3 attempts at each quiz, and if you submit a quiz within the first 10 days after the deadline, you can still earn all of the possible points for the quiz. Also remember not to include correct answers to the quiz questions when posting in the forums; this is a violation of Coursera¡¯s Honor Code.

We appreciate all the feedback that you have offered us in the forums. We will use your feedback to continue to improve the quality of this and future offerings of the course. Remember to use the Learner Help Center to find information regarding specific technical problems, and to use the Content Issues forum to report errors in lecture video content, assignment questions and answers, assignment grading, text and links on course pages, or the content of other course materials.

If you would like to collaborate with both current and future participants in this course, you can contribute to the Course Wiki. You can improve on your peers' contributions and create content that is useful for everyone in the course.
Finally, as a reminder, all of the deadlines for Week 3 of the class are this Sunday, March 1, at 11:55 PM CT (time zone conversion). See the Week 3 Overview page for more details.

Best,
Jiawei Han

Hi Yu, 

It's Steve from Regression Methods. I hope you're enjoying the break. If you're still interested in working on some machine learning problems, here is the site I was referring to: 

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions

I think the datasets here are really interesting too: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/

There's a dataset there that shows physical movements from sensors that needs to be categorized. That sounds pretty interesting. There's a whole lot more as well. If you wanna bounce ideas around on any of that stuff, let me know.

Enjoy your break!

Steve

Greetings 2013 Amazon interns!
 
Here is some information that will be helpful when filing your 2013 US federal tax returns. It¡¯s long, but please read through to the end to make sure you have all the information.
 
Your W-2 form (required to complete your tax return) will be available electronically on the ADP website on January 31, 2014, and a physical copy will be mailed to you at the address you provided to the Amazon Employee Resource Center (ERC). If you did not update your mailing address with the ERC prior to leaving Amazon, please contact them at 1-800-892-7180 by December 20, and give them your updated address. If you are still interning at Amazon, you can update your address via PeoplePortal (update it by 12/20 to what your address will be in January).
 
If you required relocation assistance for your internship, make sure Graebel has your current email address and that you¡¯ve submitted for any relocation expenses. In January, Graebel will e-mail your Relocation Tax Report (RTR) detailing the taxable relocation expenses as well as the tax assistance Amazon provided. When filing your taxes, the RTR is to be used in conjunction with your Amazon W-2. Your RTR and W-2 will prove useful when applying for student loans or scholarships. Be certain the individuals evaluating your eligibility consider your earned income vs. your total income. Your RTR will show the cost of relocation, and when subtracted from your total earnings detailed in your W-2, your earned income will be known. (Your taxable relocation benefits are also located in Box 14 of your W-2.)
 
See below for directions on setting up your account with ADP as well as answers to some Frequently Asked Questions.
 
Thank you!

Hi Yu Zhao,

It was nice meeting you at orientation today. The theory textbook used is called Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer the 7th Edition. Let me know if you want more information.

11.
How is regression methods? I plan to take it next year.
I am taking statistical methods, statistical theory, and statistical programming.

12. 
Do you think they will offer it in the Spring 2015? The programming class was cancelled today. The professor hurt his tooth.

13.
Dear students,

The R^2 calculation in my posted solution to the second comps problem from the HW#7 sheet was completely wrong.  I've posted a corrected version.

14.
Your UNIX Lounge account appears to be working again.  You should be able to login without problems.

15.
Hi Yu,
 
Thanks for the confirmation. I will see you after my 1-3 pm class. If it takes me a few extra minutes to get back from class, please wait for me. I will be happy to help you think about development research. Do you have any particular topic or sub-topic in mind? If not, try to think of what interests you most, and we can talk more about it during the meeting. See you then!
 


16.
Hi Yu,
 
Hope all is well with you! I just wanted to reach out and get a feel for what you think you¡¯ll be doing at the end of your lease. I have your expiration date as 4/03/2015; will you be renewing or will you be moving? I don¡¯t need a definite answer right now, I just wanted to check in. I will need to know your plans by the middle of February.


17.

Hi Yu,
 
We would increase your rent by 3% ($45) so it would be $1,545.
 
Let me know if you¡¯re interested.

18.
Dear All,

Please note that the "Get Rooted" Orientation 2009 schedule includes the "Economics Placement Test" at 09:00 hrs on Sunday in Corns 203.  Please review your Orientation Schedule with its explanation. 

19.
It¡¯s too bad you¡¯ll miss the pizza event tonight! I will record this as a sick day not a vacation day.

20.
Yes ¨C I hope you feel better.
